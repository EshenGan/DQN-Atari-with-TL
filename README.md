# DQN-Atari-with-TL
An experiment on doing Transfer Learning on DQN agent in Atari 2600 games

comparing DQN agent trained ONLY for total of 1 million action steps on Space Invaders from scratch with another DQN agent that is pre trained on Breakout for 1 million steps before transferring CNN layers to Space Invaders to train for 1 million steps

experiments:

DQN agent w/o TL  vs  DQN agent w TL  using epsilon-greedy policy
trained weights and log file :
